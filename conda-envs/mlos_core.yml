  # Virtual packages for compiler dependencies.
  # Note: this doesn't actually install the compilers on Windows.
  # It just adds the vs2019_win-64 and vswhere packages to help find the
  # compilers which still (seem) to need to be installed manually.

  # Instead, install gpy via conda (not pip) for emukit so we can side step some compiler issues on Windows platforms.
